Our group project is about gesture keyboard.Latest similar system designs a gesture keyboard in which letters are typed in air, that are displayed in PC/laptop. The components used are Arduino board, Bluetooth module, Gyroscope and PC/laptop. The machine learning algorithm "Supervised learning" is used with some predictions along with designed project to detect the alphabet. The whole project or design is controlled by Arduino microcontroller. The project's main aim is to detect the letters by hand in air should be recognized and displayed on the PC/laptop. The gyroscope is attached to hand, so when letters are written in air, through Bluetooth module, the data is transferred to the laptop where they are displayed.
