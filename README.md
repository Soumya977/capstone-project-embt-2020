This repository is created for completing our capstone project as a professional means of communication platform between group members and as well as our project guide.

Group members - Gurman, Mohammad, Soumya

Project guide - Prof. Mike Aleshams

Our group project is about gesture keyboard. 

Latest similar system designs a gesture keyboard in which letters are typed in air, and are displayed on PC/laptop. The components used are Arduino board, Bluetooth module, Gyroscope and PC/laptop. The machine learning algorithm "Supervised learning" is used with some predictions along with designed project to detect the alphabet. The whole project or design is controlled by Arduino microcontroller. The project's main aim is to detect the letters by hand in air should be recognized and displayed on the PC/laptop. The gyroscope is attached to hand, so when letters are written in air, through Bluetooth module, the data is transferred to the laptop where they are displayed.

In our project, we are using BeagleBone Black as a master microcontroller and an ARDUINO UNO as a slave microcontroller. We will be displaying the letters on an LCD rather than a PC/Lapton. An ESP8266 module is also used to push the Letters onto the cloud infrastructure.
